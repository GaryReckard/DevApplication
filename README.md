# DevApplication

Below is a list of tools you can use to build an application.  

The Application needs to allow the users to do three things.  

1. Login to the Application
2. Take an Assessment
3. Display / Save the assessment results

<br />
<br />
Requirements
* Login must be validated from the database
* Assessment questions must come from the database
* Assessment results must be saved to the database
* Assessment results must be retrieved from the database
* You cannot use a library to interact with database, just PHP and Mysql(MSSQL)

You should fork this repo on GitHub and do the work on that repo.  Just do a pull request on this repo when you have finished.  Please include a copy of the database in the project.
